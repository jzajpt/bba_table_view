# BBA.TableView

## Overview

A TableView implementation for SproutCore version 1.4. Written out of own need of proper and maintained TableView for SC 1.4.

It currently supports some of functionality that original SC.TableView didn't have, for example:

 * columns resizing
 * in-place edit
 * sorting

## Future

Plans are to properly support future SproutCore (1.6 and higher) while maintaining support for 1.4 at least in foreseeable future.

A documentation with some nice usage examples is also coming.
